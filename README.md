## Purpose
  Beat Central is a music search service for information about artists, albums, and songs. It provides the user with a treasure trove of data for their item of interest and the ability to listen to it right on the site, using last.Fm and Spotify integration. By registering with the site, users can also favorite items and easily return to them later.

## How To Use The Site
  Type a query into the search bar and press search, just like Google. Click on one of the entries (in the artists, albums, or songs section) on the results page to be taken to a page with more information about it. On an item's page, use the built-in Spotify plugin to listen to the song, album, or artist (their top tracks). Register or log-in to our site, using the easily acccessible buttons on the top navigation bar, to use the favorites system. To favorite an item, simply click on the star to the right of its name on its page. Click again to un-favorite. To see your list of favorited items, log-in and press the "favorites" button on the top nav bar.
  
## Installation
  (For Mr. DW) Place the key.json file into the Beats/data directory of the repository. The final file address should be "Beats/data/key.json".
